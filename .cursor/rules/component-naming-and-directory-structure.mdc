- All components should go in src/app/components and be named like new-component.tsx
  - Shadcn components should go in src/components/ui
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Within the /src/app/components folder, consider organizing components by type or feature:
  - By Type: Group components like forms, buttons, layout elements, etc.
  - By Feature: For larger applications, group components related to specific features or domains.
For example:
  /src/
  ├── /app
  │   ├── /components
  |       ├── FileList.tsx
  ├── /components
  |   ├── /ui
  |   │   ├── /Button
  |   │   ├── /Modal
  |   │   └── /Card
